## ⚠️ CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### 🚨 1. **MISSING RESTAURANT ROUTING IN CHECKOUT**
**Problem:** Checkout doesn't show which restaurant the order is going to!

Current flow:
- User adds items from a specific restaurant (e.g., Döner)
- Cart is locked to that restaurant ✅
- User goes to checkout
- **❌ Checkout doesn't display restaurant name/info**
- Order is placed with restaurantId in the background
- User has NO IDEA which restaurant will fulfill the order

**Impact:** Confusing UX - users don't know where their food is coming from

**Fix Needed:**
- Display restaurant name/logo prominently in checkout
- Show "Your order from: [Restaurant Name]"
- Display restaurant address/contact info
- Show estimated preparation time per restaurant

---

### 🚨 2. **GENERIC ORDER CONFIRMATION**
**Problem:** Success screen is too generic and doesn't provide enough info

Current:
```
✅ Order Placed Successfully!
Order Number: MR12345678
Estimated Delivery: 30-45 minutes
```

**Missing:**
- Which restaurant is preparing the order
- Restaurant contact number
- Specific order items recap
- Payment method confirmation
- Delivery/pickup address confirmation
- Total amount paid

**Fix Needed:**
- Restaurant-specific success screen
- Full order summary with items
- Restaurant contact info
- Clear delivery/pickup instructions
- Track order button

---

### 🚨 3. **NO PICKUP LOCATION SELECTION**
**Problem:** User selects "Pickup" but can't choose WHICH restaurant!

Current flow:
- User adds items from Döner Restaurant
- Clicks pickup at checkout
- **❌ No option to confirm pickup location**
- Order placed but user doesn't know where to pick up

**Fix Needed:**
- If pickup: Show "Pick up from: [Restaurant Name + Address]"
- Display restaurant address prominently
- Show map/directions button
- Display restaurant phone number
- Show pickup hours

---

### 🚨 4. **PAYMENT METHOD IS PLACEHOLDER**
**Problem:** Payment methods are displayed but not functional

Current:
- Shows Card, PayPal, Cash options
- User can "select" a method
- **❌ No actual payment processing**
- Order is placed without payment

**Status:** Known issue - waiting for Stripe integration
**Temporary Fix:** Add clear message "Payment on delivery/pickup"

---

### 🚨 5. **DELIVERY FEE NOT SMART**
**Problem:** Flat €2.00 delivery fee, no logic for distance or order value

Current:
- All deliveries = €2.00
- No free delivery threshold
- No distance-based pricing

**Fix Needed:**
```javascript
// Smart delivery fee logic
if (orderTotal >= 20) {
  deliveryFee = 0; // FREE delivery over €20
} else if (orderTotal >= 15) {
  deliveryFee = 2.50;
} else {
  deliveryFee = 3.50;
}

// Add distance multiplier
if (distance > 3) {
  deliveryFee += 1.00; // Extra €1 for 3-5km
}
```

---

### ⚠️ 6. **TIP SYSTEM NOT USER-FRIENDLY**
**Problem:** Tip amount exists but no UI to select it

Current:
- `tipAmount` state exists
- Used in calculations
- **❌ No buttons/input to set tip**

**Fix Needed:**
- Add tip selector: 0%, 10%, 15%, 20%
- Custom tip input
- Show tip only for delivery orders
- Display tip amount in summary

---

### ⚠️ 7. **ORDER SUMMARY NOT VISIBLE THROUGHOUT**
**Problem:** User can't see order total while filling out forms

Current:
- Order summary only on final step
- User doesn't see running total
- No item count reminder

**Fix Needed:**
- Sticky sidebar with order summary
- Show on all steps
- Display: items, subtotal, delivery, tip, tax, total
- Update in real-time

---

### ⚠️ 8. **NO SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FIELD**
**Problem:** Users can't add delivery instructions or food preferences

Current:
- `orderNotes` state exists
- **❌ No input field in UI**

**Fix Needed:**
- Add "Special Instructions" textarea
- Examples: "Ring doorbell twice", "No onions", "Leave at door"
- Max 200 characters
- Display on order confirmation

---

### ⚠️ 9. **VALIDATION IS BASIC**
**Problem:** Form validation is minimal

Missing:
- Real-time validation as user types
- German phone number format (+49)
- Email format validation
- Bremen postal code validation (28xxx)
- Field highlighting on error

**Fix Needed:**
- Add `validation.ts` utility
- Real-time feedback
- Clear error messages
- Prevent submission with errors

---

### ⚠️ 10. **NO LOADING STATES**
**Problem:** User doesn't know what's happening during order placement

Current:
- Basic loading spinner on "Place Order" button
- No intermediate feedback

**Fix Needed:**
- Show processing steps:
  - "Validating order..."
  - "Contacting restaurant..."
  - "Confirming payment..."
  - "Order placed!"
- Progress indicator
- Disable form during submission

## Technical Specifications

### Calculations
```typescript
subtotal = sum of all cart items
tax = subtotal * 0.19 (19% German VAT)
deliveryFee = orderType === 'delivery' ? calculateDeliveryFee(distance) : 0
tip = selected tip amount (0, 10%, 15%, 20%, or custom)
total = subtotal + tax + deliveryFee + tip
```

### Delivery Fee Logic
```typescript
- Free delivery for orders > €20
- €2.50 for orders €15-€20
- €3.50 for orders < €15
- Pickup orders: €0
```

### Estimated Delivery Time
```typescript
- Base time: 25-35 minutes
- + distance factor (1 min per km)
- + order complexity (items count)
- Business hours: 11:00 - 23:00
```

### Validation Rules
```typescript
Email: RFC 5322 compliant
Phone: German format (+49 or 0) with 10-16 digits
Postal Code: 5 digits, Bremen only (28xxx)
Name: 2-50 characters, letters only
Street: 5-100 characters
City: 2-50 characters
```

## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Files Modified:
1. **`src/components/CheckoutModal.tsx`** (Main changes)

### Key Changes:

#### 1. Import Statements Added:
```typescript
import { Store } from 'lucide-react'; // For restaurant icon
import { restaurants } from '../data/restaurants'; // Restaurant data
```

#### 2. Restaurant Context Detection:
```typescript
// Get restaurant ID from cart items
const restaurantId = cartState.items.length > 0 
  ? cartState.items[0].menuItem.restaurantId 
  : null;
  
const currentRestaurant = restaurantId 
  ? restaurants.find(r => r.id === restaurantId) 
  : null;
```

#### 3. Restaurant Banner Component:
```typescript
{currentRestaurant && !orderPlaced && (
  <div className="mb-6 bg-gradient-to-r from-red-900/30...">
    {/* Restaurant info with icon, name, address, phone */}
  </div>
)}
```

#### 4. Pickup Location Display:
```typescript
{orderType === 'pickup' && currentRestaurant && (
  <div className="mt-4 bg-blue-900/20...">
    {/* Detailed pickup location info */}
  </div>
)}
```

#### 5. Enhanced Confirmation Screen:
```typescript
const renderOrderConfirmation = () => {
  // Restaurant info section
  // Order details section  
  // Full items list with prices
  // Price breakdown
  // Address confirmation
  // Action buttons
}
```

# ðŸ“§ Email Configuration Setup for MRhappy Backend

## Current Issue
The email service is configured to use SMTP (Gmail) but requires actual email credentials to send verification emails.

## Quick Setup for Gmail SMTP

### 1. Enable 2-Factor Authentication on Your Gmail Account
1. Go to your Google Account settings
2. Security â†’ 2-Step Verification â†’ Turn On

### 2. Generate App Password
1. Go to Google Account â†’ Security
2. App passwords (you might need to search for it)
3. Select app: "Mail"
4. Select device: "Other (custom name)" â†’ "MRhappy Backend"
5. Copy the generated 16-character password

### 3. Update Backend Configuration
Edit `backend/.env` file:

```env
# Replace these with your actual Gmail credentials
EMAIL_PROVIDER=smtp
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your_email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your_16_character_app_password
SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=your_email@gmail.com
SENDGRID_FROM_NAME=MRhappy Restaurant
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

### 4. Restart Backend Server
After updating the `.env` file:
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

## Alternative: Use Console Mode for Testing
If you want to test without real emails, change in `backend/.env`:
```env
EMAIL_PROVIDER=console
```
This will log emails to the console instead of sending them.

## Email Verification Flow
1. User registers â†’ Email sent with verification link
2. User clicks link â†’ Email verified
3. User can now login and place orders

## Security Features Implemented
- âœ… Email verification required before login
- âœ… JWT token-based authentication
- âœ… Password strength validation
- âœ… CAPTCHA verification
- âœ… Rate limiting
- âœ… Profile completion tracking

## Location Services Implemented
- âœ… Location permission modal
- âœ… Automatic address detection
- âœ… Manual address entry fallback
- âœ… Location-based restaurant recommendations

## Next Steps
1. Configure email credentials
2. Test registration flow
3. Test location services
4. Test complete checkout process

**Note**: The system now blocks unverified users from logging in, so email verification is mandatory for the authentication flow to work properly.

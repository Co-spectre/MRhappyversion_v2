### 1️⃣ **DELETE: MRhappywebsite/** (Entire Folder)

**What's Inside:**
```
MRhappywebsite/
├── src/                          ← OLD code
├── backend/                      ← Duplicate backend
├── project/                      ← NESTED old project
├── node_modules/                 ← Duplicate dependencies
└── package.json                  ← Duplicate package file
```

**Delete Command:**
```powershell

```

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Update Your VS Code

After deleting the folders, **CLOSE AND REOPEN** the file you're editing:

**Current (WRONG):**
```
c:\Users\yasin\Desktop\MRhappywebsite_v2\MRhappywebsite\project\src\components\LocationBar.tsx
```

**Open This Instead (CORRECT):**
```
c:\Users\yasin\Desktop\MRhappywebsite_v2\src\components\LocationBar.tsx
```

2. ❌ `project/` - Tracked but very old
3. ❌ `__MACOSX/` - Mac system files
4. ❌ `MrHappyBurger-Code/` - Old backup code
